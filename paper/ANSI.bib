abstract={The vision of the Internet of Things is a seamless integration of diverse physical objects in the Internet through a virtual representation. In recent years, the target area of IoT constantly broadened from products within supply chains and nowadays encompasses all objects that are summarized under the label of ubiquitous and pervasive computing. Therefore also building automation devices are considered for an integration in the IoT, where they are for example used to realize a smart and sustainable building operation. Ubiquitous access to the objects is facilitated by the concept of building automation systems (BAS) that already provide a virtual representation of physical objects, mainly sensors, actuators and control devices. In practice, BAS follow a layered system architecture which defines a management, an automation and a field tier. In the field tier, non-IP communication based on twisted pair, power line or radio frequency technologies is prevalent. For the backbone infrastructure at the automation and management tier, IPv4 has become the de-facto standard. At this level, the transition towards IPv6 is the most promising technology to enable the full realization of the Internet of Things vision. New features like the larger address space, self-configuration, quality of service mechanisms and security promise a better integration of building automation technology in the IoT. Therefore this article investigates the readiness and compatibility of existing BAS technologies with IPv6. The integration challenges and new opportunities of IPv6 for these technologies are presented. Furthermore, possible integration scenarios for IPv6 using BAC net as example use case are sketched.},

abstract={The current Internet addressing architecture does not verify the source address of a packet received and forwarded. This causes serious security and accounting problems. Based on the drastically increased IPv6 address space, a "source address validation architecture" (SAVA) is proposed in this paper, which can guarantee that every packet received and forwarded holds an authenticated source IP address. The design goals of the architecture are lightweight, loose coupling, "multi-fence support" and incremental deployment. This paper discusses the details of design and implementation for the architecture, including inter-AS, intra-AS and local subnet. This architecture is deployed into the CNGI-CERNET2 infrastructure -a large-scale native IPv6 backbone network of the China Next Generation Internet project. We believe that the source address validation architecture will help the transition to a new, more secure and sustainable Internet.},

title={Bulk Transfer Capacity Estimation in IPv6 Networks}, 
year={2006}, 
month={Aug}, 
pages={6-6}, 
abstract={Bulk transfer capacity (BTC) is a measure of the sustainable data throughput on a network path that is subject to congestion control algorithms, such as those used by the transmission control protocol (TCP). BTC is an important network performance metric because the vast majority of all traffic, typically around 95% of all packets, is conveyed by TCP. The performance of many Internet-based services is thus largely dependant on the BTC of the underlying network path. This paper proposes a novel tool, ReturnFlow6, for estimating the BTC of an IPv6 network path, conducted from a single point to a non-instrumented target. In order to verify the realistic operation of ReturnFlow6i a series of BTC measurements are conducted on a test network and a 'live' intranet. The results are presented, analyzed and compared against the output of BTC estimation techniques for IPv4, permitting the relative advantages and disadvantages of each approach to be established},

abstract={Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a next generation protocol that is designed to solve the problem of the current Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) depletion. With IPv6, almost anything in the world can be assigned an IPv6 address which makes communication between every single person to another possible. Besides, monitoring and sensing every single node or instrument can be done due to each item has its own IPv6 address. Realizing the features of IPv6, enterprise networks have begun deploying IPv6. Although they have not decided to deploy IPv6, IPv6 packet is possibly already in the network due to the most present operating systems supporting IPv6 and IPv6 enable is set as default. Deploying IPv6 in the existing IPv4 network results in coexistence of both protocols in the network. Thus, the coexistence condition exposed enterprise's network to higher probability of vulnerabilities and attacks. Hence, several security policies should be created to maintain security for both IPv4 and IPv6. A proper mechanism to manage the policies to ensure a secure IPv6 deployment is a necessity. Since enterprises have many branches and counterparts, it is essential to have a mechanism to distribute the policies among their branches or subnets. Therefore, the proper mechanism to distribute the security policy which will also support the green computing environment should be formed.},
