  This paper examines the impact that network protocols and standards have on the average start-up. We discuss three different examples of when protocols might present difficulties in attempting to form a new company. The first of the three focuses specifically on the current IP version update that is taking a toll on current businesses, and anyone who attempts to enter. Secondly, we look at Security protocols and their adaptation in the market place. We examine how these protocols are used to secure corporate secrets, as well as create boundaries to entry for smaller less tech-savvy firms. Lastly we look at expanding a company to multiple regions, or starting up in a region that doesn't conform to modern network protocols, making it difficult to do business. We conclude by stating the inherent trade off between a widely accepted protocol and a good sound protocol; and show that although protocols might not always help a new firm trying to get started, they are 100 \% necessary to conduct business.
