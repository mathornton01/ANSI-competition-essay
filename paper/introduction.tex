\section{Introduction}

%This paper is organized in the following way: first there will be a brief introduction whose purpose is to
%frame the majority of our arguments in a manner that will provide meaningful context throughout the duration
%of the paper. Second we introduce some of the primary topics that will be covered in the heart of this paper. 
%The next portion of the paper deals with specific examples of our broad claims in the introduction, as well as 
%a case study to support each argument. Finally we will conclude our paper with an examination of the evidence we
%presented and a discussion of how our claims were supported.

%We will begin by examining protocol's and their diverse roll in the common marketplace. The purpose of any 
%protocol is two fold: first it is supposed to help new business enter the market since there has already been an
%established precedent to follow, secondly it is to allow the work of multiple businesses to flow together 
%seamlessly. 


The organization of this paper is as follows. There will be a brief 
introduction where the paper's format, framing, topics, and previous work will
be introduced. Next will be a general discussion of different networking protocols and standards with corresponding
case studies. The topics to be discussed are network-size increase and the IP address space problem, 
global networking and countries who don't
conform, and a current effort in creating and adapting security protocols. We conclude by examining
the affects network protocols have on new businesses entering a market.


The focus of our research regards the relative ease or difficulty 
an entrepreneur faces when deciding to enter a market place saturated with technological protocols. 
Because of the rapid advancement in networking technologies that mankind made in the past
century, protocols have become more and more complex. 


Modern networking touches almost every aspect of a successful business; from 
marketing and advertisement to accepting payment and collecting customer data.
Hence it becomes necessary to inspect the costs and benefits of  
protocols before considering entrance into a market place. 


There is much interest in the overall sustainability of certain networking protocols\cite{4124025}. 
In our paper we examine the impact of exponential network growth and problems that are posed with 
IP addressing on an expanding market. There has also been work done on analyzing the development of protocols
\cite{4375858} and relaying older protocols to new uses
\cite{6296937}.  New protocols are always under development as well\cite{5977081}.
