\section{Introduction}

This paper is organized in the following way: first there will be a brief introduction whose purpose is to
frame the majority of our arguments in a manner that will provide meaningful context throughout the duration
of the paper. Second we introduce some of the primary topics that will be covered in the heart of this paper. 
The next portion of the paper deals with specific examples of our broad claims in the introduction, as well as 
a case study to support each argument. Finally we will conclude our paper with an examination of the evidence we
presented and a discussion of how our claims were supported. 


We will begin by examining protocol's and their diverse roll in the common marketplace. The purpose of any 
protocol is two fold: first it is supposed to help new business enter the market since there has already been an
established precedent to follow, secondly it is to allow the work of multiple businesses to flow together 
seamlessly.
